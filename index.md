## Welcome to Adithya Kulkarni's homepage
<span style="font-size:1.35em;">
I am a fourth year Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science at Iowa State University. I am working as a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/iastate.edu/qili/publications"> Data Mining and Knowledge Lab</a>. My supervisor is <a href="https://sites.google.com/iastate.edu/qili/">Dr. Qi Li</a>. Also, I have worked as an intern at Epsilon. My research interests are in the domain of information extraction using weak supervision, review analysis,
data mining, natural language processing, and machine learning. Through my research, I have contributed several key methods in top conferences and workshops like ACL' 2023, UAI' 2023, SIGKDD' 2022, SDM'2022, ICDM'2021 and EMNLP Findings'2020.</span>
